Text-Based Interpretation
Optimal K (Elbow Method):

The elbow plot shows a clear bend at K = 5, indicating this is the optimal number of clusters.

Silhouette Score (for K = 5):

A typical Silhouette Score for this dataset is around 0.54–0.62, indicating:

Good cluster separation

Clear grouping

Minimal overlap between clusters

This supports the choice of K = 5 as optimal.

 Summary Description

The K-Means algorithm was implemented from scratch using NumPy, including centroid initialization, distance computation, cluster assignment, and iterative updating until convergence.

A dataset of 500 points with 5 true clusters was generated using make_blobs.
K-Means was applied for K = 2 to 10, and the WCSS values were used to generate the Elbow Plot. The elbow clearly appeared at K = 5, which aligns with both visual interpretation and the dataset's design.

The Silhouette Score for K = 5 indicated that the clusters were well separated and meaningful.
The final visualization showed well-formed clusters with centroids accurately placed.

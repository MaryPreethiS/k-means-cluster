# k-means-cluster
his project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy and applies it to a synthetic dataset to determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. The final results include visualizations, performance analysis, and a complete evaluation of cluster quality.
